# Thesis
Bachelor's degree thesis (An application of the counterpoint theorem).
This is my thesis "Una aplicación del teorema de contrapunto", a partial requisite to obtain the Bachelor's degree in applied mathematics at Instituto Tecnológico Autónom de México.
Even though it can be found on the library´s website, it is not easy to access and that is why I uploaded a copy here.
My advisors were Octavio Alberto Agustín Aquino and Emilio Lluis Puebla.
